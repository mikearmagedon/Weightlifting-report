\par It's very important to search ontologies already done by someone else before starting one from scratch. We couldn't find an ontology that replaces the one developed by Hugo Dias in his thesis, because it is very specific to the sport weightlifting.
\par However, since this ontology is supposed to describe the olympic weightlifting, it's development could be started by an olympic ontology. 
\par We found in \url{http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/resources/onto/olympics.owl}  a good source to extend for Hugo's ontology particular domain.
