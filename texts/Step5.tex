In this step it is necessary to identify concept to instance relationships. An instance is a specific realization of a concept. Each realized specification of a concept is defined as the process of instantiation. Defining relationships between instances and concepts is often not employed in ontology development as many ontology development efforts focuses on high-level concept to concept relationships. Relationships between instances and concepts enable the definition of complex relationships within the ontology domain. 
    
As mentioned before, an ontology does not need to have instances and the relationships between instances and concepts do not need to be pointed out. This ontology is a perfect example, as it does not possess any instance and so there are no concept to instance relationships.
